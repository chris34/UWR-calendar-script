# Dependencies
The only dependency you need to run this script is Python 2.x. If you have not installed it already, you can simply do this under an Debian-like OS by runnig

    sudo apt-get install python
  
# Installation
Simply download (or clone) this repository. You're done!

# Usage

Go into the folder where you have downloaded the Python-script. Then open an terminal an copy&paste

    python uwr_calender.py
  
into it. Afterwards it will download some pages, which probably takes some seconds. The scipt finishes by printing out an table that uses the syntax of ubuntuusers.de. The table covers all events listed in the calendar within the next 13 days. However, the startdate will be always next Monday â€“ the day an UWR is released.
