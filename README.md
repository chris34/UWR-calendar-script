# Dependencies
The only dependency you need to run this script is Python 3.x. If you
have not installed it already, you can simply do this under an Debian-like
OS by running

    sudo apt-get install python3

# Installation
Simply download (or clone) this repository. You're done!

# Usage

Go into the folder where you have downloaded the Python-script. Then open
a terminal and copy&paste

    ./uwr_calender.py
  
into it. Afterwards it will download some pages, which probably takes some
seconds. The script finishes by printing out an table that uses the syntax of
ubuntuusers.de. The table covers all events listed in the calendar within
the next 13 days. However, the start date will be always next Monday â€“ the
day an UWR is released.
